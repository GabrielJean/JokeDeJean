# Jean the Qu√©b√©cois Bot
A Discord bot that tells jokes, roasts your friends, gives compliments, and reads it all out loud in a Qu√©b√©cois accent (GPT-4o TTS voice) ‚Äî and manages a queue so you don‚Äôt miss anything even if several voice commands are sent in a row!

## Main Commands

## How the Queue Works
When multiple members send audio commands (mp3/TTS reading), each request is placed in a queue and played **in order**.
üëâ Nobody will be ‚Äúcut off‚Äù: everything will be read in order without conflict.
## Bonus
- **Logs**: all bot activity is recorded in `bot.log`
- **Multi-server** compatible
- **Configurable accent** (with `/say-vc` or `/gpt`)
## Examples
```bash
/joke
/jokeqc
/roast @Martin 5 "Always late to games, loves pizzas"
/compliment @Julie "awesome at Mario Kart, best laugh on the server"
```
