# Jean the Qu√©b√©cois Bot
A Discord bot that tells jokes, roasts your friends, gives compliments, and reads it all out loud in a Qu√©b√©cois accent (GPT-4o TTS voice) ‚Äî and manages a queue so you don‚Äôt miss anything even if several voice commands are sent in a row!

## Main Features
- **Jokes from Reddit / Qu√©b√©cois jokes / special sound effects**
- **Fun slash commands**: `/joke`, `/jokeqc`, `/gpt`, `/roast`, `/compliment`, `/say-vc`, `/say-tc`, `/leave`, etc.
- **Smart voice reading**: the bot reads jokes and messages in the voice channel (GPT-4o TTS, configurable Qu√©b√©cois accent)
- **Customizable compliments and ‚Äúroasts‚Äù**, with the option to provide facts/memes for more personalized jokes
- **Audio queue**: multiple readings can be scheduled and will play one after another, with no conflict even if several members send commands at the same time
- **Built-in /help** (lists all bot commands)
## Two-Bot Mode (Exact Two Profiles)
Supports exactly TWO profiles ‚Äî simple and minimal:

1. `main` ‚Äì everything except music-related commands (`music`, `yt`, `suno`)
2. `musiconly` ‚Äì only music-related commands plus essentials (`help`, `util`, `settings`, `moderation`, `bot_mention`)

Configure both tokens directly in `config.json` (preferred ‚Äî no shell exports needed):

```jsonc
{
    // Tokens map: the loader picks the entry matching COMMAND_PROFILE
    "tokens": {
        "main": "XXXX_MAIN_BOT_TOKEN",
        "musiconly": "YYYY_MUSIC_BOT_TOKEN"
    },
    // Optional single fallback token (unused if tokens map has the profile)
    "token": "(optional-fallback)",
    "tts_url": "TTS_API_URL",
    "azure_endpoint": "https://your-azure-endpoint.openai.azure.com/",
    "azure_api_version": "2024-12-01-preview",
    "gpt_model": "azure-gpt-5-nano",
    "api_key": "AZURE_OR_TTS_KEY",
    "bot_system_prompt": "You are a helpful Qu√©b√©cois assistant."
}
```

Run in two terminals (no env tokens required):

```bash
COMMAND_PROFILE=main python -m discordbot.main
COMMAND_PROFILE=musiconly python -m discordbot.main
```

Or use the dual launcher (see below) which spawns both automatically. If you ever want a custom subset of modules you can still set `COMMAND_MODULES="mod1,mod2"`, but normally you just pick the profile.

The `/help` command automatically shows ONLY the commands loaded for that process.
### Run both profiles with one command
If you prefer not to open two terminals manually, use the bundled launcher:

```bash
python -m discordbot.run_both
# or
python discordbot/run_both.py
```

What it does:
* Spawns two child processes (`COMMAND_PROFILE=main` and `COMMAND_PROFILE=musiconly`).
* Prefixes each output line so you can distinguish them: `[main:OUT]`, `[musiconly:ERR]`, etc.
* Gracefully shuts both down on Ctrl+C (SIGINT) or SIGTERM.

Environment tips:
* You do NOT need to export any `DISCORD_TOKEN` variables; the code resolves the active token from `config.json` based on `COMMAND_PROFILE`.
* Advanced (optional): setting `DISCORD_TOKEN` will override the profile token for that one process, but this is not needed in normal usage.

Future enhancements (easy to add later): auto-restart flags, health pings, unified structured JSON logs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9 or higher
- **discord.py** ‚â• 2.3
- The following Python modules: `discord`, `discord.ext`, `requests`
- A configuration file `config.json` in the format:
    ```json
    {
      "token": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE",
      "tts_url": "TTS_API_URL",
      "azure_gpt_url": "GPT_API_URL",
      "api_key": "APIKEY_FOR_APIS"
    }
    ```
- A folder `./Audio` with MP3 files (for Qu√©b√©cois jokes and special sound effects)
## Installation
1. **Install the modules**
    ```
    pip install discord.py requests
    ```
2. **Create the `config.json` file** (see above)
3. **Add your MP3 sounds** to the folder `./Audio`
4. **Start the bot**
    ```
    python tonbot.py
    ```
    Or with module (recommended):
    ```bash
    DISCORD_TOKEN=xxxxx python -m discordbot.main
    ```
## Main Commands
- `/help` ‚Äì Shows all bot commands
- `/joke` ‚Äì Plays a Reddit joke in voice
- `/jokeqc` ‚Äì Plays a local Qu√©b√©cois joke (mp3)
- `/leave` ‚Äì Forces the bot to leave the voice channel
- `/say-vc <text>` ‚Äì Reads out text (configurable accent)
- `/say-tc <text>` ‚Äì Writes text in the text channel
- `/gpt <question>` ‚Äì Asks GPT-4o a question and reads the answer (voice/text)
- `/roast @member [intensity] [details]` ‚Äì Fun public roast, Qu√©b√©cois accent (level 1 mild to 5 salty)
- `/compliment @member [details]` ‚Äì Personalized and vocal compliment, Qu√©b√©cois accent
- `/reset-prompts` ‚Äì Resets system prompts and TTS server configs
## How the Queue Works
When multiple members send audio commands (mp3/TTS reading), each request is placed in a queue and played **in order**.
üëâ Nobody will be ‚Äúcut off‚Äù: everything will be read in order without conflict.
## Bonus
- **Logs**: all bot activity is recorded in `bot.log`
- **Multi-server** compatible
- **Configurable accent** (with `/say-vc` or `/gpt`)
## Examples
```bash
/joke
/jokeqc
/roast @Martin 5 "Always late to games, loves pizzas"
/compliment @Julie "awesome at Mario Kart, best laugh on the server"
```
